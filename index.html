        I graduated Occidental College in 2020. At the FJM Foundation, I work closely with <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dreier'>Congressman David Dreier</a>, former <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules#Chairs,_1849%E2%80%931853_and_1880%E2%80%93present'>chairman of the House Rules Committee</a>, to recruit student journalists to participate in the construction of a memorial on the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall'>National Mall</a> commemorating fallen journalists.

        At Occidental, I majored in Politics and minored in Economics and Urban & Environmental Policy. I wrote my senior thesis on Israel-related partisanship in the United States Congress. I interviewed nineteen current and former members of Congress as part of my research.
        I have worked on six political campaigns since the age of thirteen.
